 <h3>About us</h3>
   <p>Our story started in 1976. It began with our founder, Anita Roddick, opening a little green shop in Brighton with a belief in something revolutionary: that business could be a force for good.</p>
   <p>We’ve never been your average cosmetics company, with over 40 years of campaigning, change-making and smashing beauty industry standards – and we’re still going strong. Welcome to The Body Shop.</p>

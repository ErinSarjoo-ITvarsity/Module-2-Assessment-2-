 <h3>H&M</h3>
 <h3>About us</h3>
   <p>Doppio believes that life is too short to be serious — unless it’s about the food we eat, company we keep, or the coffee we love. This is the distinctive essence of the Mediterranean approach to life; which has inspired who we are, and is what we believe is the simplest recipe for living well and happy. </p>
   <p>We exist to bring contemporary and consistently fresh moments of Mediterranean-inspired living to the communities we serve. Where real good-mood food and uplifting personal connection are effortlessly enjoyed in our aspirational and ‘localised’ eateries, where you always feel comfortable to be you.</p>
